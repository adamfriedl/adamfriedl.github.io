<!-- ### Interesting Stuff -->

Regardless of the field, the success I've found in my career results from a lifelong obsession with learning. I decided to become a professional software developer after working with some tech folks and seeing how much of their job involved learning new things.

My previous career was as a public interest lawyer and consultant, advocating on a wide range of civil and criminal justice reform issues across the United States.

Recreational interests include languages (Spanish, Italian, French), surfing, and maps.

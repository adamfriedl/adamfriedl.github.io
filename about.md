### Interesting Stuff

Regardless of the field, the success I've found in my career results from a lifelong obsession with learning. I decided to become a software developer after working with some tech folks and seeing how much of their job involved learning new things.

My other work has been as a public interest lawyer and consultant, advocating on a wide range of justice reform issues both in New York and across the United States.
